This is my "Javascript Calculator" project for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-javascript-calculator).


This project took me about 6 hours in total, 1 hour for designing, and 1.5 hours creating it with HTML, CSS (less), and 3.5 hours writing the Javascript functionality. Of course I used adobe XD to design it, and you can [download my project file here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7ArzBuNX7W9Q2NfeGJBbDBGRzg).

As always, any feedback is appreciated.
